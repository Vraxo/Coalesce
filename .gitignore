# Visual Studio / .NET Ignore List
#
# Get latest from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/VisualStudio.gitignore
#
# This file is simplified for a modern .NET project where all build outputs
# are redirected to a single top-level folder.

# --- Build Output (The MOST IMPORTANT Rule) ---
# Ignore the entire directory where all compiled code, intermediate files,
# and other build artifacts are now stored.
/_artifacts/

# --- User-specific Settings ---
# These files store your personal workspace settings, window layouts, etc.
# and should not be shared with the team.
*.rsuser
*.suo
*.user
*.userosscache
*.sln.docstates
*.userprefs

# --- IDE/Editor Directories ---
# Caches and settings for Visual Studio and other editors.
.vs/
.idea/
.vscode/

# --- Coalesce Tool Generated Files ---
# Ignore files generated by the 'coalesce' tool itself to avoid committing
# test runs or local configurations from the dev environment.

coalesce.yaml
coalesce-run.bat
coalesce-run.sh
